Review
Now you have the ability to repeat execution of code blocks as necessary in your PHP programs.

Here is a summary of the topics covered in this lesson:

while loops execute only as long as their conditional evaluates to TRUE.
doâ€¦while loops always execute at least once and then continue executing while their conditional is TRUE.
for loops contain 3 expressions and are frequently used to execute a code block a specific number of times.
The first expression is executed prior to the first iteration.
The second expression is evaluated prior to each iteration. If TRUE, the code block executes. Otherwise, the loop terminates.
The third expression is evaluated after each iteration.
foreach loops are used for iterating over the elements of an array. The key and value of each element is available in the code block.
break is used to end execution of a loop early.
continue is used to end execution of a loop iteration early and continues to the next iteration. */

//Some examples of embedded PHP loops in HTML 
  
  <ul>
<?php
for ($i = 0; $i < 2; $i++):
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
endfor;
?>

</ul>


<ul>
<?php
$array = [0, 1];
foreach ($array as $i):
?>
<li>Duck</li>
<?php
endforeach;
?>
<li>Goose</li>
</ul>

$repeats = [0, 1];
while ($i < 5):

Review
With the PHP shorthand you have just learned, you can now create more readable HTML files with embedded PHP loops.

Here are the key ideas from this lesson:

The PHP shorthand for loops uses a colon (:) instead of a bracket ({) to open the code block.
The shorthand uses keywords to close the code block instead of a bracket (}):
Use endfor to close a for loop
Use endforeach to close a foreach loop
Use endwhile to close a while loop
The closing keyword needs to be followed by a semicolon (;).
Make sure to re-enter PHP mode using <?php or the echo shorthand <?= before using PHP variables in the loop */
